# chrome-win-lock
Chrome extension to prevent new tabs opening on certain windows.

This is useful if you have multiple windows open but you always want new tabs to be created in your main window.

Click the lock icon in the toolbar to lock or unlock a window. New tabs will only be created on your unlocked windows.

I don't feel like putting this on the chrome store. If you want to use it, you can just clone the repo and [load it](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) using the extension manager.

## Known Issues

Occasionally the extension seems to lose state and I haven't been able to figure out why. Disable the extension, then reneable it again to get it working.

# chrome-win-lock
Chrome extension to prevent new tabs opening on certain windows

I don't feel like putting this on the chrome store. If you want to use it, you can just clone the repo and [load it](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) using the extension manager.
